There are different classifiers depending on the inputs. 
Your starting w0 and step size changes how long the algorithm will run.
Problem 3
I picked a quadratic curve because it is able to fit the points the best.
When comparing curves to best fit the points, I found a quadratic with a low lambda fit the most points.
I compared a quadratic curve with a high lambda to help prevent over-fitting.
A quadratic with a high lambda still won over a linear curve.
